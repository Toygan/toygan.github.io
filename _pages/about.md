Welcome!  
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota, specializing in MRI reconstruction, parallel transmission (pTx), and deep learning for medical imaging. My research combines signal processing, optimization, and machine learning to address challenges in high-field MRI technology.

Previously, I worked in radar system design, FPGA development, and image processing at ASELSAN and ORTANA, as well as multi-contrast MRI reconstruction during my Master’s studies at Bilkent University. These experiences shaped my expertise across domains such as MR image reconstruction, radar SAR, HDR imaging, embedded systems, and low-level algorithm implementation.
