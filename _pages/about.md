Welcome!  
I am **Toygan Kilic**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at the University of Minnesota, specializing in **MRI reconstruction, parallel transmission (pTx), and deep learning for medical imaging**. My research combines **signal processing, optimization, and machine learning** to address challenges in high-field MRI technology.

Previously, I worked in **radar system design, FPGA development, and image processing** at **ASELSAN** and **ORTANA**, as well as multi-contrast MRI reconstruction during my Master’s studies at **Bilkent University**. These experiences shaped my expertise across domains such as **MR image reconstruction, radar SAR, HDR imaging, embedded systems, and low-level algorithm implementation**.  

On this site, you will find information about my **publications, talks, projects, teaching, and CV**.
