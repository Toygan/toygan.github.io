Welcome!  
I am Toygan Kilic, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota, specializing in MRI reconstruction, parallel transmission (pTx), and deep learning for medical imaging. My research combines signal processing, optimization, and machine learning to address challenges in high-field MRI technology.

Previously, I worked in radar system design, FPGA development, and image processing at ASELSAN and ORTANA, as well as multi-contrast MRI reconstruction during my Master’s studies at Bilkent University. These experiences shaped my expertise across domains such as MR image reconstruction, radar SAR, HDR imaging, embedded systems, and low-level algorithm implementation.  

On this site, you will find information about my **publications, projects, teaching, and CV**.

Research Highlights
======
- **Deep Learning for Parallel Transmission (pTx):** Developed unsupervised CNN-based methods for B_1^⁺ inhomogeneity correction at 7T in collaboration with Siemens.  
- **Diffusion MRI Reconstruction:** Designed physics-driven priors and score-based denoising methods for accelerated and artifact-corrected diffusion imaging.  
- **Radar System:** Implemented and optimized radar imaging algorithms, communication protocols (UART, I^2C), and real-time FPGA-based designs.  
- **Image Processing:** Experience in HDR imaging pipelines, camera calibration, and medical image quality enhancement.
